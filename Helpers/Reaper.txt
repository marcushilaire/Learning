All our times have come
Here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the Reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain
And we can be like they are

Come on, baby
Don't fear the Reaper
Baby, take my hand
Don't fear the Reaper
We'll be able to fly
Don't fear the Reaper
Baby, I'm your man

Valentine is done
Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity
Romeo and Juliet

40,000 men and women every day
Like Romeo and Juliet
40,000 men and women every day
Redefine happiness
Another 40,000 coming every day
We can be like they are

Come on, baby
Don't fear the Reaper
Baby, take my hand
Don't fear the Reaper
We'll be able to fly
Don't fear the Reaper
Baby, I'm your man

Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone

Came last night of sadness
And it was clear that we couldn't go on
The door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared
Saying, "Don't be afraid."

Come on, baby
And we had no fear
And we ran to him
Then we started to fly

We looked backward and said goodbye
We had become like they are
We had taken his hand
We had become like they are

Come on, baby
Don't fear the Reaper
Don't fear the Reaper
Don't fear the Reaper
Don't fear the Reaper
Don't fear the Reaper
Don't fear the Reaper

We have become like they are
Like Romeo and Juliet
We have become like they are
Like Romeo and Juliet
We have become like they are
Like Romeo and Juliet
We have become like they are
Like Romeo and Juliet
We have become like they are
Like Romeo and Juliet
We have become like they are
